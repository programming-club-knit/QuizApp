Issues in the Code
1. No Validation for Unanswered Questions:

If a user skips a question, the app doesn’t handle it gracefully. It simply marks it as incorrect.

Fix: Add validation to ensure all questions are answered before submitting.

2. No Feedback on Correct/Incorrect Answers:

After submitting, the user only sees their score but doesn’t know which questions they got wrong.

Fix: Highlight correct and incorrect answers after submission.

3. No Timer:

The quiz doesn’t have a time limit, which could make it less challenging.

Fix: Add a countdown timer for each question or the entire quiz.

4. Static Questions:

The questions are hardcoded and cannot be dynamically loaded (e.g., from an API).

Fix: Fetch questions from an API or a JSON file.

5. No Randomization:

The questions and options are always displayed in the same order.

Fix: Randomize the order of questions and options.

6. No Progress Indicator:

The user doesn’t know how many questions are left or their current progress.

Fix: Add a progress bar or a counter (e.g., "Question 3 of 10").

7. No Local Storage for High Scores:

The app doesn’t save high scores or previous attempts.

Fix: Use localStorage to save and display high scores.

8. No Responsive Design:

The app may not look good on smaller screens.

Fix: Add responsive CSS for mobile devices.

9. No Option to Restart:

Once the quiz is submitted, the user cannot restart without refreshing the page.

Fix: Add a "Restart Quiz" button.

10.No Accessibility Features:

The app lacks accessibility features like keyboard navigation or ARIA labels.

Fix: Add accessibility improvements for better usability.
